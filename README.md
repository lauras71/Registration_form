# Registration form

## Content

This repository contains two files (an .html and a .css) for a registration form landing page. 
The users' submissions are handled thanks to the _Formspree_ software. Each submission is stored on the Formspree dashboard, and an email is sent back to the form owner.

## Functionality

This landing page was created for an event where spots were limited, and thus a registration was needed.
